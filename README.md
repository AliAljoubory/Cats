# Cats
Cats is a take home project that uses TheCatAPI to allow a user to search through different breeds of cats and gain unique information about each one.

Upon retrieving all cat breeds from the API, it presents them in a collectionView with the ability to dynamically search through the list. Each breed contains further information such as an image, energy level and a wikipedia URL which can be accessed from within the app.

Cats includes the use of Dark Mode and Dynamic Type throughout the app and some Unit Tests.
